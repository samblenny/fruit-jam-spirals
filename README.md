# Fruit Jam Spirals

**DRAFT: WORK IN PROGRESS**

This draws hypotrochoid spirals (like Spirograph) for Fruit Jam's DVI display.

This code was developed and tested on a pre-release revision B Fruit Jam
prototype board using CircuitPython 10.0.0-alpha.6 from the circuitpython.org
[Fruit Jam downloads](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_fruit_jam/) page.
Things may change by the time CircuitPython 10.0.0 is released.
